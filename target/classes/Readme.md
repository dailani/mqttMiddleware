It looks like you've made good progress in your project. You have the Robot class that handles MQTT communication, the RobotServer class that registers the Robot object in the RMI registry, and the RobotClient class that looks up the robot from the RMI registry and sends a message.

Here's a summary of what each part does:

Robot class:

Represents a robot that can send and receive MQTT messages.
Initializes an MQTT client when a robot is created.
Provides methods to handle incoming messages (handleIncomingMessage) and send messages (sendMessage).
Implements the RobotInterface to expose remote methods.
RobotServer class:

Creates a new Robot instance.
Sets up an RMI registry and binds the Robot object to it.
RobotClient class:

Looks up the Robot object from the RMI registry.
Calls the sendMessage method of the remote Robot object to send a message.
MqttMiddlewareClient class:

Connects to an MQTT broker and subscribes to election topics.
Handles incoming MQTT messages, specifically the "election/initiate" topic, and forwards them to the next robot.
